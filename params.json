This is not intended to be used. If you use it, you run the risk of being manually review banned. A better option is to review to the best of your ability and report any bad audits on meta. A review ban incurred by multiple bad audits can be lifted by moderators if the bad audits are indeed bad audits.\r\n\r\n##Styling\r\n###[SO Dark](https://github.com/Tiny-Giant/myuserscripts/blob/master/SODark.user.js)\r\n\r\nThis is really buggy right now, best to just not use this yet.",
